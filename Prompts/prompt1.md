### **Optimized Shot List**

**Shot 1 (0.00–3.50) — “Eight Provinces United” (32 mm, tripod dolly in)**
 Description: Grand ceremony in Nanjing beneath German imperial banners and the yellow “Eight Provinces United” flag. Warlord Wu Peifu stands at a podium, sunlight breaking through haze; German officers stand behind. Flags ripple in the wind.
 Purpose: Establish the new German-dominated order in China — triumph mixed with submission.
 Audio: Crowd ambience, German anthem fragment. Wu Peifu’s voice continues off-screen after the cut:

> “今匪患已绝，吾辈当在帝国的提携下，重整八省，振兴东南，偕满清政府，重建中华。”

------

**Shot 2 (3.50–7.50) — “Concession City” (50 mm, crane down through city)**
 Description: Aerial glide over Shanghai’s International Settlement. Colonial façades lined with black-white-red tricolor flags; bilingual signs in German and English. Trams pass civilians in 1920s attire.
 Purpose: Show surface prosperity under occupation, quiet tension beneath.
 Audio: Faint German background voices — “Das Wetter ist heute schön.” / “Danke.” (soft, casual dialogue).

------

**Shot 3 (7.50–11.00) — “Remnants in the Hills” (85 mm, handheld close)**
 Description: Rainy Jiangxi countryside. Soong Ching-ling speaks to weary Nationalist soldiers(Th) beside mud huts and torn flags. Dim oil lamps flicker; rain drips from eaves.
 Purpose: Evoke tragedy and resistance, contrasting imperial triumph with moral despair.
 Audio: Soong Ching-ling (in Mandarin, overlapping Wu Peifu’s off-screen speech):

> “中山，对不起”
>  Tone: trembling, mournful; mixed with rain ambience and distant thunder.

------

**Shot 4 (11.00–15.00) — “The Emperor Returns” (50 mm, static midshot)**
 Description: Beijing winter street, 1928. Citizens crowd around a newspaper stand. Headline in Chinese and German reads:

>  “Die Qing-Regierung kehrt zurück – Puyi besteigt den Thron.”
>  The paper’s front photo shows the Qing imperial dragon flag and a black-and-white portrait of Emperor Puyi.
>  People’s reactions are mixed — curiosity, unease, quiet resignation. A vendor slowly turns away.
>  Purpose: Depict the restoration of monarchy as the culmination of German dominance; ambiguity among the people.
